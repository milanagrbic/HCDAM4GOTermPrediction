Starting networks: Networks based on metabolic reactions. The lists of reactions are taken from the Systems Biology Research Group
 website of the University of California, San Diego\footnote{http://systemsbiology.ucsd.edu/Downloads}.
Metabolites are represented as vertices, while there is an edge between two metabolites if they participate in at least one common reaction.
In each line, last number is edge weight (not used in this algorithm).

Folder Reduced networks: Starting networks reduced according to Rule 3 from [1].
